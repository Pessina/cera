<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="4">1 - In the root folder of the project run: “yarn start”<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Approach</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="12">1 - The first step was to look the layout and think about what are the components on this screen.<br>
2 - The second step was add the colors and sizes to css variables.<br>
3 - The third step was create the components using mock data.<br>
4 - The fort step was to integrate with the API and start using real data.<br>
5 - The fifth was improve the code: changing classes names, creating more components, removing unnecessary code, etc.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="13" data-line-end="14">The task it’s simple but I tried to show how I will structure a big project.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="15" data-line-end="19">1 - Create separated folders for the API, Components, Assets, Utils …<br>
2 - Each DB model have it’s own file, so we can place all get, post, put, delete requests in a single file<br>
3 - The components follow the Atomic Design Pattern, so they are very reusable and easy to do the maintenance<br>
4 - All the API calls have error handling</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="20" data-line-end="21">Extra: I don’t know how the mobile design should be. But I added the auto-fill, property to the grid, so the design will not break on the first resize of the screen.</p>
